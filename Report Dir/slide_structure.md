⚡ Training Characteristics
Parameter Efficiency: Only the mapping network is trained (~1% of parameters)
Loss Calculation: Only text tokens contribute to loss; visual prefixes are masked
Objective: Causal language modeling, learning cross-modal alignment
Advantages: Reduces computational complexity, prevents overfitting on small datasets


💡 Summary of Evaluation Principles
Task Adaptability: Different evaluation metrics for different question types

Medical Specificity: Considers clinical validity and semantic accuracy

Benchmark Consistency: Follows Med-VQA domain standard practices

Comprehensiveness: Multi-dimensional assessment of model capabilities
